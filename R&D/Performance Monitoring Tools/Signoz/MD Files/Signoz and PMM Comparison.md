| Custom Query Performance Metrics   | Lets users define and track specific MySQL performance metrics.                               |

PMM is the best choice if your focus is deep MySQL performance tuning and database health monitoring.

## 2. Features Available in SigNoz but Not in PMM

SigNoz is a full observability platform that covers application-level monitoring, logs, and traces, which PMM lacks.

| Feature                                  | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Performance Monitoring (APM) | Tracks web/API requests, microservices, and overall app performance.                     |
| Distributed Tracing                      | Uses OpenTelemetry to track requests across multiple services (great for microservices). |
| Real User Monitoring (RUM)               | Measures actual user interactions with the frontend (page load times, latency).          |
| Log Management                           | Collects, indexes, and analyzes logs (not just metrics).                                 |
| APM for Multiple Languages               | Supports Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, and more via OpenTelemetry.                        |
| Microservices Monitoring                 | Provides deep visibility into distributed applications.                                  |
| Service Dependency Graph                 | Maps how different services interact and their response times.                           |
| Custom Alerts for Application Metrics    | Allows setting up alerts based on application performance metrics.                       |
| Application Error Tracking               | Captures and analyzes application errors and stack traces.                               |
| Frontend Performance Monitoring          | Tracks browser-side performance issues.                                                  |

SigNoz is better for full-stack application monitoring, tracing, and log management across microservices.

| Prometheus-Based Metrics         | Uses Prometheus for metric collection.                         |
| Alerting & Notifications         | Supports alerting via Slack, PagerDuty, Email, etc.            |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Allows managing user access and roles.                         |
| Docker & Kubernetes Support      | Can be deployed via Docker and Kubernetes.                     |
| Open-Source & Self-Hosted        | Both are open-source and can be installed on your own servers. |
| Grafana Integration              | Can be used with Grafana for visualization.                    |
| Cloud & On-Prem Deployment       | Can be deployed on cloud platforms or on-premises servers.     |

Both SigNoz & PMM provide system monitoring, dashboards, alerts, and open-source flexibility.
