| Historical Data Retention    | ‚úÖ Yes (stores long-term data)            | ‚ùå No (data resets on restart)                            |
| Graphical Visualization      | ‚úÖ Yes (with Grafana or Prometheus UI)    | ‚ùå No (only text-based queries)                           |
| Query-Level Analysis         | ‚ùå Limited (only pre-defined metrics)     | ‚úÖ Yes (detailed query profiling with Performance Schema) |
| Alerting System              | ‚úÖ Yes (supports custom alerts)           | ‚ùå No built-in alert system                               |
| Custom Metrics Support       | ‚úÖ Yes (can define custom metrics)        | ‚ùå No (only predefined metrics)                           |
| Lightweight on MySQL         | ‚úÖ Yes (low overhead)                     | ‚ùå No (Performance Schema adds some overhead)             |
| Complex Query Debugging      | ‚ùå No                                     | ‚úÖ Yes (Performance Schema + Slow Query Log)              |

## üîπ Which One Should You Use?

### ‚úîÔ∏è Use Prometheus if:

- ‚úÖ You need real-time monitoring and alerting.
- ‚úÖ You want to track long-term performance trends.
- ‚úÖ You need an external monitoring system that doesn't slow down MySQL.
- ‚úÖ You are working with DevOps tools and want easy integration.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Use MySQL Built-in Tools if:

- ‚úÖ You need detailed query-level analysis.
- ‚úÖ You want to debug slow queries and locks.
- ‚úÖ You need deep insights into query execution plans.
- ‚úÖ You don't want to set up an external monitoring system.

## üîπ Final Verdict: Which One is Better?

### ‚úÖ For General Monitoring ‚Üí Prometheus is Better

- Great for real-time metrics, alerting, and long-term storage.
- Less impact on MySQL performance.

### ‚úÖ For Deep Query Analysis ‚Üí MySQL Performance Schema is Better

- Best for query optimization, deadlock detection, and detailed execution statistics.
- More useful for DBAs and developers troubleshooting slow queries.

## üîπ Recommended Approach for R&D

Since you are doing R&D, the best approach is:

1. Use Prometheus to monitor overall MySQL health (CPU, queries/sec, slow queries, memory).
2. Use MySQL‚Äôs Performance Schema when you need deep query-level insights (execution time, locks, indexing issues).
3. Use MySQL Workbench for graphical performance reports and query tuning.
