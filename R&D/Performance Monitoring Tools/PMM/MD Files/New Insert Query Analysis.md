# **MySQL High CPU Usage Investigation in PMM (Query Analytics - QAN)**

## **Step 1: Simulating High CPU Usage with Bulk Insert Query**
To analyze high CPU usage in PMM, we executed the following bulk **INSERT query**:

```sql
INSERT INTO test_cpu (id, name)
SELECT
  t.n,
  CONCAT('CPU_', t.n)
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      (
        a.N + (10 * b.N) + (100 * c.N) + (1000 * d.N) + (10000 * e.N)
      ) AS n
    FROM
      (
        SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
      ) a,
      (
        SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
      ) b,
      (
        SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
      ) c,
      (
        SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
      ) d,
      (
        SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9
      ) e
  ) t;
```

This query inserted **100,000 records**, creating a **high CPU load** in MySQL.

---

## **Step 2: Measuring CPU Usage from Prometheus Metrics**
To check the **CPU usage caused by this query**, we use the following **Prometheus query**:

```promql
100 * rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{service_name="mysql"}[5m]) / count(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"})
```

This query calculates **MySQL's CPU consumption** as a percentage of total user CPU time over the last **5 minutes**.

## **Step 4: Analyzing Query Impact in PMM Dashboards**

### **üîπ Check Query Load in QAN**
1. Navigate to **PMM ‚Üí Query Analytics (QAN)**.
2. Sort queries by **CPU Time** and **Execution Time**.
3. Click on the **INSERT INTO test_cpu** query to check **Query Execution Stats**.

### **üîπ Analyze MySQL Instance in PMM**
1. Navigate to **PMM ‚Üí MySQL Instance Summary**.
2. Check the following key metrics:
   - **Threads Running** ‚Üí Spikes indicate contention.
   - **Temporary Tables Created** ‚Üí High numbers suggest query inefficiencies.
   - **InnoDB Buffer Pool Usage** ‚Üí Monitors memory impact.

### **üîπ Check CPU Usage Impact**
1. Navigate to **PMM ‚Üí Node Summary**.
2. Look for:
   - **CPU Usage (%)** ‚Äì Is MySQL consuming most of it?
   - **I/O Wait (%)** ‚Äì High values indicate storage bottlenecks.
   - **Memory Usage** ‚Äì Ensures MySQL isn't swapping.

## **Step 5: Identifying the Root Cause of High CPU Usage in PMM**
Now that we have analyzed MySQL's performance metrics in PMM QAN, MySQL Instance Summary, and Node Summary, let's correlate this data to determine the exact cause of high CPU usage.

### **üîç Step 5.1: Identify the Primary Cause Using PMM Dashboards**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check PMM ‚Üí MySQL Instance Summary**
- Look at **Threads Running** ‚Üí Are too many active queries causing CPU contention?
- Check **Temporary Tables Created** ‚Üí Are excessive temp tables slowing execution?
- Analyze **Handler Read Metrics** ‚Üí High **Handler_read_rnd_next** may indicate full table scans.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Check PMM ‚Üí MySQL InnoDB Metrics**
- Look at **Buffer Pool Reads & Writes** ‚Üí Is the buffer pool overloaded?
- Check **Row Operations** ‚Üí High row operations may indicate inefficient queries.
- Analyze **InnoDB Log Waits** ‚Üí High values suggest transaction bottlenecks.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Check PMM ‚Üí Node Summary**
- Look at **CPU Usage by Process** ‚Üí Is MySQL the top CPU consumer?
- Check **I/O Wait Percentage** ‚Üí High I/O wait suggests storage bottlenecks.
- Analyze **Load Average** ‚Üí If consistently high, MySQL is overloading the system.

### **üìå Step 5.2: Verify if the Identified Cause Matches the Original High CPU Spike**
- Cross-check findings with **PMM QAN, MySQL Instance Summary, and Node Summary**.
- If MySQL‚Äôs CPU consumption aligns with the **INSERT query execution time**, we have confirmed our high CPU usage cause.
- If multiple queries contribute, analyze them separately in **QAN**.

## **Conclusion**

Based on the metrics, the **INSERT INTO test_cpu** query significantly impacted the CPU usage:

- **High Query Time**: The query took 1.63 seconds on average, accounting for 97.51% of the total load.
- **Rows Affected**: The query affected 100,000 rows, indicating a high volume of data processing.
- **Full Join and Full Scan**: The query involved multiple full joins and full scans, which are CPU-intensive operations.
- **Temporary Tables**: The query created 5 temporary tables, suggesting inefficiencies.

Overall, the query is confirmed to be a major contributor to high CPU usage.
