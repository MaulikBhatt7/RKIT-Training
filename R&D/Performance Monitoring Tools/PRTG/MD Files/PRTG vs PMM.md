## **4. Which is Better for MySQL Monitoring?**

### âœ… **Choose PMM if:**

- You need **detailed MySQL query performance analysis** (e.g., slow query logs, query execution plans).
- You want **deep MySQL-specific performance monitoring**.
- You prefer an **open-source, highly customizable solution**.
- You need **query analytics (QAN) and real-time profiling**.
- You work with **large-scale database environments**.
- You want **better integration with MySQL Replication and performance tuning tools**.

### âœ… **Choose PRTG if:**

- You need **general infrastructure monitoring** (not just MySQL).
- You want **easy setup with out-of-the-box sensors**.
- You prefer **agentless monitoring**.
- You need **network traffic, server health, and process monitoring** along with MySQL.
- You work in a **Windows-heavy environment**.

## **5. Final Verdict**

- **If MySQL performance tuning is your priority â†’ PMM is the better choice**.
- **If general IT infrastructure monitoring is your priority â†’ PRTG is better**.
- **For a hybrid approach, you can use both together**:
  - **PRTG for infrastructure monitoring** (server health, uptime, general MySQL metrics).
  - **PMM for deep MySQL performance analysis** (query execution, slow queries, optimization).
