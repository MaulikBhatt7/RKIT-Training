here I have created a procedure by right click on db and select query tool and here connection is like db_name user1 now I create a proc on table_1 then I create a user2 from that window itself then I register a new server with user2 now I open query tool from new server and then I write select all from table_1 then it gives permission denied now I go in user1 window and give select and insert privileges now I go in user2 then I run select command it executes now I call that proc from window of user2 which is created by user1 and proc also executed but the rule says only user1 has right of proc to execute default
